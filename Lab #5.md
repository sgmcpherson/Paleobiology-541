## Problem Set #1

1)	
	Bivalve richness= 634
	sum(BivalveAbundance[“Miocene”,])

2)	
	Berger-Parker Index= 0.2222222
	max(BrachiopodAbundance["Pliocene",])/sum(BrachiopodAbundance["Pliocene",])

3)	Gini-Simpson Index= 0.9784588
	
	ginisimposn<-function(x,interval){
	a<-sum(x[interval,])^2
	b<-x[interval,]^2
	c<-b/a
	d<-1-sum(c)
	return(d)
	}
	
	ginisimpson(BrachiopodAbundance,”Late Ordovician”)

4)	Shannon’s Entropy= 5.086654
	
	Shannon<-function(x,interval){
	a<-x[interval,]
	b<-a[a!=0]
	c<-sum(b)
	d<-b/c
	e<-d*log(d)
	f<- -sum(e)
	return(f)
	}
	
	Shannon(BivalveAbundance,”Late Cretaceous”)

5)	Shannon”s Entropy= 4.511875
	
	Shannon(BivalveAbundance,”Paleocene”)

6)	percentage change= 0.8870025

	Shannon(BivalveAbundance,”Paleocene”)/Shannon(BivalveAbundance,”Late Cretaceous”)

	Between the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene periods a mass extinction event occurred, commonly called 
	the K-Pg extinction.  Thus, this would severely reduce biodiversity, given that it is estimated that nearly 
	75% of all species perished.  This does not appear to be reflected in the Shanon index. 


	> -0.5 points, you need to take 1-0.88

7)	percentage change= 0.5628292
	
	exp(Shannon(BivalveAbundance,”Paleocene”))/exp(Shannon(BivalveAbundance,”Late Cretaceous”))

	This number appears to be an underestimated of the change between the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene 
	periods, given that it is estimated that 75% or species went extinct during this period.  However, it is 
	much closer the the previously calculated values.

	> You need to do 1-0.56, -0.5 Points

## Problem Set #2

1)	=634

	specnumber(BivalveAbundance[“Miocene”,])

2)	=0.9784588

	diversity(BrachiopodAbundance[“Late Ordovician”,],index=“simpson”)

3)	=5.086654

	diversity(BivalveAbundance[“Late Cretaceous”,],index=“shannon”)

4)	=4.511875

	diversity(BivalveAbundance[“Paleocene”,],index=“shannon”)

## Problem Set #3

1)	 = -0.2376513, negative

	Bivalve<-specnumber(BivalveAbundance)

	Brachiopod<-specnumber(BrachiopodAbundance)

	cor(Bivalve,Brachiopod)

> It should be closer -0.5, -1 Points

2)	= -0.2624135, negative

	(diversity(BrachiopodAbundance,index=“simpson”),diversity(BivalveAbundance,index=
	“simpson”))

3)	The greatest drop in brachiopod richness occurred between the Lopingian and Early Triassic epochs.
