	Brachiopods, molluscs, shrimp, snails, trilobites, bivalves

	Since all of the taxa are from aquatic environments, where they could be rapidly buried under sediments 
	that were low in organic matter and where there may have been water with low dissolved oxygen, all are 
	most likely good data.  Thus, none of the taxa arenâ€™t good candidates for pyritization.

	I tried to choose the most common taxi for the string.

	I would trust the truncated names more.
